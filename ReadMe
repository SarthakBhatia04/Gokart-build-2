Note: Regarding Solidworks Parts and Assembly
The parts constructed in Solidworks are not up to scale. This discrepancy arises due to the fact vendors do not give precise measurements of their components. The purpose of designing and constructing the parts and assembly is to serve as a visual display of the functionality and relationship between the components.
